ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am Melissa, a graduate of Geographical Engineering from the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, who interested in technology, I decided to specialize as a Front end Web Developer, to create and optimize interactive websites that are functional and intuitive.

ðŸŽ“ During my formative stage in the tech world, fascinated by programming and the solutions it can provide, I decided to give life to prototypes using HTML, CSS and JavaScript mainly, through projects focused on the user's need. I also have knowledge of tools such as React JS, Sass, collaborative work in Git and Github, responsive web development, package management with NPM, database in Firebase and testing in Jest.

My work experience using cartographic tools, preparing maps or developing applications in GIS platforms on the Web, aroused my curiosity in the technological world. I am passionate about everything related to programming and web development, I feel that starting on the client side is a good strategy to understand the logic of the code and at the same time visualize its capacity.

ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to develop my skills as a Front end in a technology company that allows me to apply what I have learned and continue to grow both personally and professionally, I want to provide original and efficient web solutions, based on the needs of the user and the objective of the company.
